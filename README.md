# Chat-Room-in-Java
A simple chat room in Java with GUI. 

1. User must login to talk and receive others' message
2. Server show users list on the right.
3. When a new user join or an old user leave, the server will broadcast that information.
4. When a user leave, the online user will remove him, and at the same time his's user list will be clear.
5. A user can exit this appication by click "exit", at the same time, he will be logged out.

The following screenshot shows how this app work. I simulate two users' little talk.
